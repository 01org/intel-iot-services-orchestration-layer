<h2 id="center">Center</h2>
<p>While the <strong>Hub</strong> manages the <strong>Things</strong> (which is collection of <strong>Services</strong>), <strong>Center</strong> manages all <strong>Hubs</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Center</strong> provides the HTML5 Web IDE so that developers could navigate through a modern browser to create IoT applications. The UI defined by the created IoT Application, is also powered by HTML5 so that end users could also use browser and navitage to <strong>Center</strong> to see the user interface of the application.</p>
<p>The <strong>Workflows</strong>, the logic of the IoT application, which is defined by developers through drag and drop in the IDE, is also stored at <strong>Center</strong> and executed by <strong>Center</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="broker">Broker</h2>
<p>The <strong>Workflow</strong> uses <strong>Services</strong> managed by various <strong>Hubs</strong>. Therefore, during the execution of the <strong>Workflow</strong>, the <strong>Center</strong> need to communicate with these <strong>Hubs</strong> to send messages to and receive messages from the <strong>Services</strong> on these <strong>Hubs</strong>.</p>
<p>Such communication (send / receive or publish / subscribe of messages) happens with the help of a message <strong>Broker</strong>. The <strong>Broker</strong> acts like a proxy, a message (no matter from <strong>Center</strong> to <strong>Hub</strong> or from <strong>Hub</strong> to <strong>Center</strong>) is always sent to <strong>Broker</strong>, and <strong>Broker</strong> would correctly dispatch it to the right target.</p>
<p>Intel(r) IoT Services Orchestration Layer allows to use multiple type of <strong>Brokers</strong>, for example, a <strong>Broker</strong> based on MQTT, or based on HTTP, etc. Please see <a href="#getstarted/advanced/configuration">Configuration</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Advanced developers could enable more kind of <strong>Brokers</strong> by implemented a very limited set of APIs required by Intel(r) IoT Services Orchestration Layer.</p>
