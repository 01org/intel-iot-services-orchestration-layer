<h1 id="thing">Thing</h1><h2 id="introduction-of-thing">Introduction of Thing</h2><p><strong>Thing</strong> represents a thing which is connected with the <strong>hub</strong>. It can provide several services for user/developers. For example, <em>LED</em> is a thing, and <em>turn on</em>, <em>turn off</em>, <em>dim</em> are services of the thing.</p><p>The connection between thing and hub can be wired, wireless, or builtin.</p><h2 id="directory-layout">Directory Layout</h2><p>Each <strong>Thing</strong> is a directory, which is contained by the thingbundle folder and must has the <code>thing.json</code>.</p><p>For example, the thingbundle path is <code>bundle/</code>, and its tree graph is as follows:</p><pre><code>bundle
|-- display
|   `-- led
|       `-- thing.json
|-- sensor
|   |-- sensor0
|   |   `-- readme
|   |-- sensor1
|   |   `-- thing.json
|   `-- sensor2
|       `-- thing.json
`-- doc</code></pre><p>Then <em>led</em>, <em>sensor1</em> and <em>sensor2</em> are things, while <em>sensor0</em>, <em>display</em>, <em>sensor</em> and <em>doc</em> are <strong>NOT</strong> things because they don't contain <code>thing.json</code> directly.</p><h2 id="thing.json"><code>thing.json</code></h2><p><code>thing.json</code> is the description JSON file of the thing. It has the following properties.</p><ul><li><code>id</code>: String. The unique id of the thing. Default: one created by the path and hub id.</li><li><code>name</code>: String. The thing name, which will be showed in the web IDE. Default: the name of the thing folder.</li><li><code>description</code>: String. The description of the thing.</li><li><code>is_builtin</code>: Boolean. If true, the thing and all its services cannot be changed and removed. Default: false.</li></ul>
